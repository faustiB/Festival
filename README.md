# Festival

This is an App that manages a festival. 

It is developed in C, and it is intented to learn how to handle the dynamic memory allocation.

The app needs three different files: 

 - Bands
 - Musicians
 - Venue
      
Each file has at its beggining the total quantity of elements that are in the file. 
I will add three basic files as example, but feel free to modify them, but mantaining the same structure/format. 


The program is divided in two parts: 
  - First: Verify that the file is correctly inserted. ( Assuming the good grace of the user, that inserts the correct name when it is                    demanded)
  - Second: In this part, there is a menu with 4 options: 
    - 1. Show Bands or Venues.
    - 2. Calculate minimum ticket price ( Cache of band / capacity of venue )
    - 3. Show band members
    - 4. Exit of menu.
